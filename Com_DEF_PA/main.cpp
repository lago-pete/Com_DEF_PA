/*ADVANTAGES/DISADVANTAGES LINKED LIST: Advantage: Having a Linked list allows you to have dynamic sizing, 
this is useful because of the constant adding to the list. Disadvantage: Acessing specific points in the linked list isnt nearly as good as an array,
you have to traverse instead of just select.*/


/*ADVANTAGES/DISADVANTAGES ARRAY:  Advantage: Having an acess ready index, Disadvantage: Having a fixed size, its hard to have it dynamic, at least compared to a list
